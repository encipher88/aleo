INSTALL STICKERS TO YOUR DISCORD SERVER

How to Add Discord Stickers

You can only add and manage a server's stickers on desktopâ€”Android and iOS aren't supported.

To add stickers to a server:

Navigate to the server.

Click the server's name in the top-left.

Click Server settings.

From the left menu, click Stickers.

If your server is a high enough level, click Upload sticker.

Give your sticker a name, upload the file, and choose a related emoji (this is so your sticker appears as a suggestion to match emojis when someone is searching stickers). You can also add a description to help those with screen readers.

When you're happy with how it looks, click Upload.

These are the requirements for your image file:

PNG (static) or APNG (animated) file type

500KB maximum file size

320 x 320 pixels exactly
